# Show Docker Image history info from Dockerhub without downloading images

There are so many Docker images on Dockerhub, but when we want to check their image history(What commands are included inside current image), it is always painful especially I have to process over 1000+ images, therefore, I wrote this python script to help me do this through checking webpage source code using different filters.

See examples for more info!
